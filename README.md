# CIFAR-Image-Classifier

**CIFAR-10** is a very popular computer vision dataset. This dataset is well studied in many types of deep learning research for object recognition.

This dataset consists of 60,000 images divided into 10 target classes, with each category containing 6000 images of shape 32*32. This dataset contains images of low resolution (32*32), which allows researchers to try new algorithms. The 10 different classes of this dataset are:

* Airplane
* Car
* Bird
* Cat
* Deer
* Dog
* Frog
* Horse
* Ship
* Truck  

CIFAR-10 dataset is already available in the datasets module of Keras.  

The **goal** of the project was to build convolution neural network(CNN) in Keras and use this classifier to classify images. A GUI for this classifier has been created which can be used to directly upload images and check if the image is correctly classified. Details on how to use this GUI are mentioned in the notebook.
